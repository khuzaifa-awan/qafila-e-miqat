      question: 'How much will Umrah cost?',
      answer: 'The cost of Umrah depends on your travel dates, hotel preference, and transport choice. Economy packages usually start at a budget-friendly range and include 3-star hotels with shared transport. Standard packages are moderately priced, featuring 4-star hotels closer to Haram with more comfort. Luxury packages are on the higher end, offering 5-star hotels nearest to Haram along with private transport. Prices depend on airline availability and the season, especially during Ramadan when costs are generally higher. For an exact quote, please share your travel dates and requirements with us.'

      id: 'faq-7',
      question: 'What safety measures are in place for solo female travelers?',
      answer: 'We prioritize safety for all pilgrims, especially solo female travelers. According to Islamic teachings, a woman must be accompanied by her Mahram when traveling for Umrah or Hajj. This guidance is for her honor, comfort, and protection. At Qafila-e-Miqat Travel, we strictly follow this principle and only arrange Umrah packages for sisters who are traveling with their Mahram. This ensures safety, peace of mind, and alignment with the Sunnah.'

      id: 'faq-8',
      question: 'How do I make payments and what is your cancellation policy?',
      answer: 'A small advance (usually 30â€“40%) is required, with the balance payable before departure. If you need to cancel your booking, please inform us as early as possible. Flight tickets, visa fees, and hotel bookings are subject to airline and supplier rules, which may be non-refundable. In addition, a small amount of service charges will be deducted from the refundable amount. Any remaining balance after deductions will be returned to you. We handle cancellations fairly, with honesty, and in line with Islamic values of trust (Amanah)'
